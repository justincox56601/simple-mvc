# simple-mvc
This is a simple MVC for a web development class I am teaching.  The students have just learned about different desgin patterns and are starting to put all of the individual parts together.  This project shows them how the MVC pattern can be used to create a websited in PHP.

There is not database included.  I opted to make that a hard coded associative array in the database service.

To make this work, you will need to include an .htaccess file that will redirect all incoming requests to your primary index page.
